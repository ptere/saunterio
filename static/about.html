        <p>Saunter is a simple service that monitors the forecast and alerts you the night before a day of
        particularly good weather arrives. It’s essentially the opposite of storm alerts. If you’ve ever
        been stuck in a meeting, staring longingly through the window at a blue sky, and thought, &ldquo;if only
        I’d known a little in advance, I could be outside right now,&rdquo; then Saunter is for you.</p>

        <p>In its current form, Saunter only works for the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, but expansion
        to the contiguous United States is planned. Saunter understands that the weather changes over the
        course of the year, and what many would consider a &ldquo;nice day&rdquo; in winter is different
        from a &ldquo;nice day&rdquo; in summer. The algorithm underlying Saunter is primed with five years
        of weather history, and alerts when the forecast indicates the next day’s weather will put it
        among the top 5% of days for that period of the year. Saunter currently uses a subjective but
        widely-shared set of criteria to judge the forecast, and looks at temperature, humidity, wind speed,
        cloud cover, and precipitation. Allowing users to set their own weather preferences is likely to
        appear in a future version, but is not planned for initial release.</p>

        <p>Saunter is currently in pre-alpha. Sign-ups for alerts will open once Saunter launches.</p>
