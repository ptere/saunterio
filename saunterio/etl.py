    Mapping Forecast.io fields to QCLCD fields

    Sources of comparison:
    QCLCD: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/qclcd/qclcddocumentation.pdf
    Forecast.io: https://developer.forecast.io/docs/v2

    Temporal:
    ObsTimeISO8601: hourly.data.[0-48].time (in UNIX time, which is GMT)
    SunriseISO8601: daily.data.1.sunriseTime (in UNIX time, which is GMT)
    SunsetISO8601: daily.data.1.sunsetTime (in UNIX time, which is GMT)
        Sunrise and sunset:
        Index 1 means 'next day' after the current request. Presumably this is calculated on local time,
        and reported in GMT. Should confirm empirically. Also, there are parts of the world where the sun
        does not rise or set in a given day during parts of the year. Those cases need to be handled to match QCLCD.
        Currently they are excluded (simply an edge case not yet worth the time to handle correctly).
        Value in that case for Sun<rise,set>ISO8601 should be 'NoDayNight'.

    Meteorological:
    DryBulbFarenheit: temperature (units are degrees Fahrenheit)
    DewPointFarenheit: dewPoint (units are degrees Fahrenheit)
    WindSpeed (units are MPH): windSpeed (units are MPH)

    HourlyPrecip (units are inches per hour): precipIntensity (units are inches per hour)
        precipIntensity is "the average expected intensity of precipitation occurring at the given time conditional on
                            probability"
        HourlyPrecip is "Precipitation totals (inches and hundredths)
                         Hourly totals if column 20 is 'AA' (hourly METAR report)."
        This means both have significant ambiguity, but since the goal is only a binary assessment of whether
        there's any precipitation at all, that's okay.

        Tue Jan 26 10:38:34 EST 2016:
        Setting the binary precipitation cutoff at precipIntensity >= 0.07, which equates to something a little
        stronger than 'very light rain' according to Forecast.io. This is based on a very rough analysis of
        a few recorded forecasts, and correlates to a low precipProbability (quite roughly, 10% or under).
        This needs to be re-evaluated once more forecasts are collected and a better quantitative analysis
        can be done.

        MongoLab queries:
        Query:  {'hourly.data.precipIntensity':{$gt:0.07}}
        Fields: {'hourly.data.precipIntensity':1, 'hourly.data.precipProbability':1}
        Expand âˆž in bottom right

    SkyCondition:
        Forecast.io provides `cloudCover`, which is a decimal percentage of cloud cover.
        QCLCD SkyCondition values are:
            CLR: CLEAR BELOW 12,000 FT
            FEW: > 0/8 - 2/8 SKY COVER
            SCT SCATTERED:  3/8 - 4/8 SKY COVER
            BKN BROKEN: 5/8 - 7/8 SKY COVER
            OVC OVERCAST: 8/8 SKY COVER
        Simple switch/case should suffice

    It's more computationally efficient, but a little less modular, to do the next_day_only check in this function.
    Placing it outside would mean doing all the timestamp resolution twice.
